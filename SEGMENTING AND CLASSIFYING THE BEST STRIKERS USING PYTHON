SEGMENTING AND CLASSIFYING THE BEST STRIKERS

INTRODUCTION

In football, strikers play a pivotal role in deciding the fate of matches and championships. Identifying the best strikers among a pool of talent involves a comprehensive analysis of various factors ranging from performance metrics to personal attributes.
This project, takes a deep look into a dataset containing information on 500 strikers, aiming to uncover patterns, insights, and classifications that distinguish top-performing strikers from the rest.


PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project involves utilizing data analytics techniques to explore and understand the characteristics and performance metrics of strikers. By employing descriptive statistics, data visualization, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms, we identify the key attributes that contribute to a striker's success and classify them based on their performance.

PURPOSE

The primary goal is to provide a systematic framework for analyzing and categorizing strikers based on their performance metrics and personal attributes. This analysis helps coaches, scouts, and football analysts make informed decisions in team selection, recruitment, and strategic planning.
